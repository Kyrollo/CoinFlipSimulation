# CoinFlipSimulation

This repository contains a Python script that simulates coin flips to calculate and analyze the percentage of heads and tails over multiple trials.

## Description (optional)

The project is a simple simulation of coin flips designed to demonstrate basic statistical analysis using Python. By running multiple trials of coin flips, the script provides an understanding of probability distribution and random processes. This can be a useful educational tool for learning about randomness, probability, and statistical analysis.

## Features

- Simulates a specified number of coin flips per trial.
- Runs a specified number of trials.
- Calculates and prints the average percentage of heads and tails over all trials.

## Usage

To run the script, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
